## Setup Procedure

1. Find a suitable location to setup the recording equipment.
	- Take note of where the video cable for the projector is located
	- Take note of where the nearest power socket is located (relative to the video cable)
	- Does the venue have a table for you to place your equipment? If not, get a stable chair

2. Setup power strip

3. Setup the HDMI splitter + HDMI cables
	- This is so that presenter & organizers can check that their laptops are compatible with our setup as well as the projector's resolution
	- If its not realistic to keep the splitter on the equipment organizer, just remove it and position it near the speaker + video cable for the projector

4. 	Place the laptop (do not switch on yet) and connect the charger (start the power)
5. Setup the tripod + webcam
6. Setup the equipment organizer
	- Connect all the USB cables (blue, green & brown dot) to the laptop
	- Connect the micro USB charger to the wireless microphone receiver
	- Connect the HDMI cable to the screen capture device (if the splitter is not on the blue platform)
7. Setup the wireless microphone transmitter
	- Attach the lapel microphone
	- Switch on and check battery level (at the receiver)
	- The audio interface should also light up (green LED ring around the audio knob) when you speak into the microphone

8. Start the laptop & start OBS Studio
9. Check that you have a good capture
	- Ensure that you are getting video feed from the webcam, screen capture device (ensure a laptop is connected for presentation)
	- Ensure that you are getting a good audio feed from the wireless lapel microphone (green audio level bar should hover around 50-80% when presenter is speaking)
10. Try a test recording & verify that you can produce the video file
